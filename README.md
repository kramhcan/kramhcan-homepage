This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About this website

I created this website with the hopes of being able to stand out to potential employees.  
This is my first time creating a React app, I used Next.js app and tried adding some cool stuff I found online.

I do plan to either polish this or create a more refined version of this website.

Base path is acting weird, currently ugly fix by changing to absolute path for ProjectComponent and manually adding prefix for Title image
